            Even though Valley of Love has quite a romantic name, it is actually
            a theme park located just three miles away from Đà Lạt. This place
            is filled with gardens and flowers for everyone of all different
            ages to come and see. This is a very peaceful place surrounded by
            hills and a verdant forrest. There are countless amount of photos
            that could be taken here because of how all the flowers and plants
            are creatively organized. Additionally, families can even come here
            to have a picnic while being able to stare at a nice view right in
            front of them.</strong

          <strong>
            Elephant Falls is one of the most visited attractions in the Đà Lạt
            area. It is absolutely stunning to look at and at the bottoom of the
            water fall there is even a pool. It stretches 30 meters in height
            and 15 meters in width, it is surrounded by a forrest and huge
            boldering rocks at the bottom of the waterfall. This place is family
            friendly and is only 15 miles away from Đà Lạt. Legends say that
            this waterfall was created by elephants that were really moved by a
            woman's singing to her fiance that never made it back from the war.
            Overall, there is no going wrong when visiting a place like
            this.</strong
